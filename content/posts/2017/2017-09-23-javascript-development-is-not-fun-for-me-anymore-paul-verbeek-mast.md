[Paul Verbeek-Mast][1]:

> Fast-forward to 2017. I’m slamming my keyboard in frustration as another mysterious error appears in my build script. I don’t know how this works! I also don’t care. Plus, now I have to learn what Redux is, and how Vue is the next best thing that happened since Angular 2.0. How to use styled-components to make JavaScript in React do what CSS can do on it’s own. And whenever I switch projects, something has broken because I don’t understand how Node works. And I should know, because I’ve been a front-end dev for 8 years, and Node is JavaScript, so I should know Node.

There are so many articles expressing frustration with JavaScript in one form or another that it can&#8217;t simply be a few lazy, whining developers with an axe to grind. Something seems broken. It&#8217;s a sentiment that&#8217;s keeping me from digging in, certainly.
