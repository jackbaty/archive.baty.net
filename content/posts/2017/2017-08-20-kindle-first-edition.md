> It was a bright, defrosted, pussy-willow day at the onset of spring, and the newlyweds were driving cross-country in a large roast turkey.

When my long-preordered first-generation Kindle finally arrived in 2007, it seemed like magic. One of the first books I bought for it was [”Skinny Legs and All”][1], which was my first Tom Robbins novel.

That first Kindle was weird and funky and not for everyone. Much like Tom Robbin’s novels, in a way, but I loved them both. 

I’ve upgraded to the latest Kindle several times since that goofy original edition. The newest, “Oasis”, is a great reading device. I’ve already read and enjoyed every Tom Robbins novel. None though, neither Kindles nor Robbins, were quite as delightful and surprising as the first.
