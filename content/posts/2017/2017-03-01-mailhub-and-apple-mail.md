I’ve been reeling things in lately, software-wise. I’ll write more about
that some other time, but I right now I want to share something I’ve
found during the process.

[MailHub](http://dervishsoftware.com/)

Mailhub is “a ‘smart’ plug-in for Apple Mail that revolutionises email
management”. Sounds great, but I haven’t used Apple Mail in years. I use
[MailMate](https://freron.com/), which is a fantastic email client.

Or at least I used to use MailMate.

After reading Dr. Drang’s [Back to Apple
Mail](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2017/02/back-to-apple-mail/) post, I
realized that switching to the stock Apple email app would fit right in
with the reel-things-in phase I’m going through. Dr. Drang mentioned
Mailhub so I jumped right in.

Mailhub is terrific. It files mail like I’ve always wanted something to
file mail. It feels and works like a tool I would have made, if I was
able to do such a thing.

After a few days of this I’m quite happy to be using Mailhub and
Mail.app.
