I love trying new things, but I’m not sure why bother. I’ve had most things figured out for years. 

Here’s a quick, incomplete list of software and hardware that have continued to work for me, doing what they were designed to do, without much fuss or trouble, for a very long time. In no particular order.

## Software
Apps and formats that have been around a long time and have burned themselves into my life. These are the things I always come back to.

* BBEdit
* Tinderbox
* DEVONthink
* Text files (a la Markdown)
* nvAlt
* Photo Mechanic
* OmniFocus
* Vim
* Dropbox
* Files and folders, organized neatly, viewed in Finder (or Pathfinder)
* Transmit

## Hardware
I look for newer, better, faster all the time. Sometimes I find it, but mostly I just keep using these…

* Leica M6 w/50mm Summicron and Tri-X
* Domke satchel
* DVDs (or now, Blu-ray)
* Manual typewriters (Olympia SM3, mostly)
* iPhone
* Pen and paper
* Watch (automatic)
*
