I didn&#8217;t think I needed a microblog but I think I need a microblog. I like writing short posts and sharing random images and links. These don&#8217;t need titles or tags or other meta data. They&#8217;re just throw away thoughts, but I wouldn&#8217;t mind if they were preserved just the same.

Here are my options:

<ol class="org-ol">
  <li>
    Post everything, including short (microblog) posts at <a href="https://jack.baty.net/">jack.baty.net</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue using <a href="https://snippets.baty.net">snippets.baty.net</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Just use Twitter and be done with it
  </li>
</ol>

I don&#8217;t like the chatter or the hassle of dealing with title-less posts on my main blog, so that&#8217;s out.

I like the control and flexibility of WordPress but it&#8217;s too heavy for just a microblog. Also, it lends itself to non-stop tweaking. Plus, I don&#8217;t feel like babysitting another WordPress install. So then snippets.baty.net is out.

Mastodon is almost the right thing but the iOS apps never seem to work well enough. For example, I like Amaroq but I can&#8217;t post photos with it for some reason. My RSS feed from Mastodon includes any replies, which makes for a lot of unwanted noise when syndicating elsewhere. I may revisit this later.

Using Twitter would be great except that it&#8217;s, well, Twitter.

Although each has its pros and cons and I change my mind a lot, for now I&#8217;m going to run with Micro.blog and cross post to Twitter.

<ul class="org-ul">
  <li>
    The iOS app is nice and getting better.
  </li>
  <li>
    It&#8217;s basically a static site rendered for me and I love the idea of static sites
  </li>
  <li>
    I can easily get things out of it
  </li>
  <li>
    I don&#8217;t have to maintain anything
  </li>
  <li>
    It&#8217;s all very IndieWeb friendly so that&#8217;s a bonus.
  </li>
</ul>

I&#8217;m starting it back up again at [micro.baty.net][1].
