description: "Using Alexa to control Sonos speakers"
---

I have several Sonos speakers in my house. I also have several Amazon Echos. I've always wanted them to work together, and [now they can](http://www.sonos.com/en-us/alexa-on-sonos). 

I installed the latest Sonos and Alexa apps, let Alexa "discover" my Sonos devices, and now I can say, "Alexa, play Tom Petty in the living room" and that's what she does. It's been working great so far. The Sonos speakers are vastly superior to the little Echo speakers. 

Apple still [has a lot of catching up to do](/2017/how-did-amazon-become-my-smart-home-hub-before-apple/).
