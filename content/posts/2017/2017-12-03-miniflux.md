[Eli Mellen][1] mentioned [Miniflux][2] one too many times so I had to give it a go.<figure class="wp-block-image">

Miniflux is a bare-bones RSS reader that you host yourself. It uses SQLite for storage so it's super simple to install and run. I've imported many of my feeds into it and so far it's working great. It has very good keyboard support, which is important to me. It's fast, simple, and efficient.
