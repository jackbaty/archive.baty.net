title: Back to the Apple Watch for a Week – The Brooks Review
---

[Ben Brooks][1]:

> Whereas, when I look at one of my traditional watches on my wrist, I get joy from looking at them 

I wear my Apple Watch most days, but I do it begrudgingly. I like that it unlocks my computer. I like that it shows me the weather, and I like that sometimes it conveniently notifies me about important things. I don't mind that it tracks my steps, event though I don't get any real value from that.

Most of the time it's nothing more than a tiny annoying iPhone on my wrist.

And I'll never love it as much as I love my real, automatic watches.
