Known (https://withknown.com/) is described as "a social learning platform," but
it seems to work pretty well for publishing a microblog (or any blog for that
matter). 

I have been testing it at [snippets.baty.net](https://snippets.baty.net) and
it works fine. The thing is, it doesn't offer much over a standard Worpress
install, so I don't see the point. It also feels as if Known is _accidentally_ a
decent indieweb-enabled blogging platform. I'm not comfortable relying on
something for which my primary use case is a side effect of the tool.

So, I'll be suspending my use of Known and archiving the few posts I've
published with it. For now, I'll publish either to this blog
or [micro.blog](https://micro.baty.blog) while I figure out how I want all of
this to work.
