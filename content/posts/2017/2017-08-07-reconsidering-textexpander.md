It was only a couple of weeks ago that I [bailed on TextExpander][1] and moved my text snippets to Alfred. It felt good to be rid of a monthly subscription and to run one fewer app on my machines. 

But, and [Dr. Drang nailed it][2], I miss having text expansion on my iPad. I’m writing this in Ulysses on the iPad and just wanted enter the date and time for the post. Instead of typing `,dt` and getting `2017-08-07 08:05 PM`, I had to type it all out like an animal. I don’t know of any reliable, integrated, and easy-to-use expansion utilities on iOS other than TextExpander, so, like Dr. Drang, I’m going back. I’ll just pay for a year up front so I’m not reminded that it’s a subscription for a while.
