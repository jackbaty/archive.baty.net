I don’t know what to use mlkshk for, even though I’ve been a paid user
for several years. What I do know is that Mlkshk is so quirky and
different that I’m planning to find a place for it in 2017.

Here’s mine: <http://mlkshk.com/user/jackbaty>

Update 02/22/2017: This from MLKSHK today: “We are closing MLKSHK. 🙁 ”

I was mostly inactive, but still paid, user. I wanted them to succeed.
