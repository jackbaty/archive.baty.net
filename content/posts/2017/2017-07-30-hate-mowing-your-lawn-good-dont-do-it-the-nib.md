title: Hate Mowing Your Lawn? Good! Don’t Do It - The Nib

I would love to either not have a lawn or be able to completely ignore it. The compromise so far has been paying too much money for someone else to deal with it. Our obsession with having a perfect lawn and landscaping is ridiculous.

Having a brown lawn would be totally fine with me. Having the only brown lawn in the neighborhood is something I'm not prepared to tackle yet.
