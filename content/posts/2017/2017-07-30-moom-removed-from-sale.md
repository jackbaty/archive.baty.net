title: Moom removed from sale

[Many Tricks Blog][1]

> "Tonight we received notice that Moom is in violation of US patent number 8434019, Apparatus and method for positioning windows on a display. Yes, someone has patented positioning windows on a screen via a grid. Given we’ve been notified of a patent violation, we have no choice but to remove Moom from sale, effective immediately." 

I try every window manager that comes along and I always go back to Moom. I hope someone helps them bury the patent troll behind the takedown notice.
