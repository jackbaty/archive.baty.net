[Kodak](http://htl.li/IzYN309GtdO):

> Consumer and Film Division (CFD) revenues for the fourth quarter were
> \$45 million, down from \$63 million in Q4 of 2015. Operational EBITDA
> declined from \$14 million to negative \$2 million.
>
> For the year, revenues for CFD were \$216 million, down 18 percent
> from \$265 million, driven primarily by a \$32 million expected
> decline in consumer inkjet revenues. Operational EBITDA for the
> division was down \$36 million for the year, driven by the reduction
> in consumer inkjet as well as investments supporting the KODAK Super 8
> Camera and future camera platforms.

I'm rooting for Kodak, so this doesn't look like the best possible news.
I'm hanging my hopes on the word "investments".
