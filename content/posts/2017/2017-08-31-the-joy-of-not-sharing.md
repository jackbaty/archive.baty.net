title: The Joy of Not Sharing

![Gail and I - Manistee (2017)][1]

I love sharing my photos. I joined [Flickr][2] in 2004 and after that just about every other service imaginable, with [Instagram][3] being (reluctantly) the latest.

But recently I’m finding a sort of joy in _not_ sharing photos. Specifically, I’ve noticed that I haven’t bothered scanning or posting any of my recent Polaroid or Instax images. They’re instant,  analog, and each one is a precious artifact. 

I haven’t been deliberately not posting them anywhere, but now that I’ve noticed it I like the idea. It’s surprisingly difficult keeping things to oneself these days, so having this private box of memories feels good.
