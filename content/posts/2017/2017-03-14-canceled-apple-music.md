Ever since my favorite music streaming service, Rdio, was shut down, I've been forced to find a replacement. The contenders were Spotify and Apple Music. I've never loved Spotify, and iTunes is a mess. I subscribed to both services to see which I prefer.

Today I canceled Apple Music and will continue using Spotify. I'd like to tell you that I have a thoroughly-considered list of reasons, but I don't. I went with Spotify because that's what the others on my family plan prefer. Spotify is good enough, so who am I to argue?

One little thing that I do appreciate about Spotify on iOS is that I can simply swipe the cover art to go to the next song. Cover art is the largest single thing in the UI I don't understand why Apple's Music app doesn't use for anything at all. I won't miss iTunes.
