I took this photo of Gene at brunch today. It&#8217;s not a good photo, but I really like it because it looks the way I want black and white photos to look. I like deep blacks, sparkly highlights, and smooth out of focus areas.

This was shot using the X-Pro2 with the 56mm f/1.2 wide open. It&#8217;s straight out of the camera via the Acros (with yellow filter) simulation.

I feel like I could actually make some decent images with this combination.
