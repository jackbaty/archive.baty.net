    ![][1] <figcaption>Ron (2017). Leica M6. 50mm Summicron. Tri-X @1250 in Diafine.</figcaption> </figure> From a recent roll, here's my dad sitting in a chair listening to my mom and sister talking. Developing with Diafine is so easy and being able to shoot at 1200+ ISO indoors is so handy that I've convinced myself that the contrasty, grainy look is what I was going for in the first place.
