You tell him, Dave.

I’ve had one of the fancy new Touch-Bar-having MacBook Pros for a few
weeks and it’s a lovely machine. But, what I’d rather have is a
slightly-faster MacBook Air with a Retina display. I want the old
keyboard and I want real function keys. I want that razor-sharp leading
edge and wonderful taper. Maybe we could compromise on the Touch Bar and
just give me Touch ID up there in the corner.

I don’t like that the best computer I’ll ever have is the one I can no
longer have.

I would also like a new MacBook Air, please.
