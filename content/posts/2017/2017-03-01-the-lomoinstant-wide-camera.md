A photograph becomes real only when it’s printed. I love photographic
prints of all kinds. This is why I’ve loved the Fuji Instax cameras. All
you get is a print. No muss no fuss.

The [Fuji Instax210](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/657176-REG/Fujifilm_15950793_Instax_210_Instant_Film.html#!)
has been fun, but let’s face it, it’s kind of ugly. The later versions
are better, but still not great. I loved the Lomo’Instant Wide the
moment I saw it. Especially the “[Central Park](https://shop.lomography.com/en/cameras/camera-best-sellers/lomo-instant-wide-central-park-combo)”
version, so I bought one.

It’s great. Here’s why I like it (compared to my old Fuji):

-   It looks great
-   Zone focusing on the lens rather than via menu
-   Controls are on the back, and are buttons and led indicators. No
    LCD.
-   The lens cap doubles as a remote shutter release. Genius!
-   Comes with various lens attachments (Close-up, super-wide, etc)
-   It’s plastic, but not as “plastic-ey” as the Fuji
-   There’s a PC sync port. I can use an external flash!

Super fun, cute, and more versatile than the one it’s replacing. I’m
happy with it.
