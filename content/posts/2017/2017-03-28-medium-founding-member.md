![Medium Profile](/img/2017/medium-profile.jpg)

[Medium](https://medium.com/) makes me nervous. I've never known exactly what it _is_ or what it wishes
to be. I've never liked the sense of importance imbued on things written there.
I don't know if they'll just disappear one day, taking years of writing with them.

And yet, Medium can be a wonderful place. I want them to succeed. I want people
to publish great content while avoiding the click-bait tendencies of many
publications. I want to enjoy reading what I find there.

So, I've paid to become a "Founding Member" of Medium. I'm spending $5.00 a
month in support of Medium's vague yet compelling mission. I get that much value
out of Medium already, so I'm out nothing, really. I'm not paying as a writer,
I'm paying as a reader. I hope they do great things.

So far, I love the new Morning, Noon, and Evening "Editions". I check in a few
times a day, read the latest, mildly-curated posts, and move on. The idea of
being _finished_ with something online is wonderful. It's why I still read a
paper newspaper, offline. 

I'm looking forward to what comes next. Good luck to Medium! [Here's me on Medium](https://medium.com/@jackbaty)
