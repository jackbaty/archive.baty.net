## I&#8217;m going to need an Everything Bucket for my Everything Buckets. {.subtitle}

The latest &#8220;Everything Bucket&#8221; is [Keep It][1] from Reinvented Software. Keep It is replacing Together, itself a fine tool for collecting things.

I&#8217;d settled on DEVONthink in recent years but lately have been looking for a simpler alternative. DEVONthink and DEVONthink To Go are a powerful combination. Maybe too powerful. I have many hours into configuring sync between my Macs and iOS devices, and sometimes I feel like I still don&#8217;t understand DEVONthink&#8217;s sync system at all. Having too many options is not always desirable.

I&#8217;ve been running with [EagleFiler][2] for the past couple of weeks and it really is great at keeping track of a bunch of &#8220;stuff&#8221;. It&#8217;s especially good with email. I haven&#8217;t minded that there&#8217;s no EagleFiler for iOS because everything is just kept in folders in Dropbox. Still, having a similar UI on both platforms would be nice.

Keep It looks nice. Like EagleFiler, it keeps my files and folder structure intact, although the library&#8217;s folder is in iCloud&#8217;s ~/Library/Group Containers/&#8230; location. Still, any app with a &#8220;Show in Finder&#8221; option is good with me.

I&#8217;m planning to throw a subset of my &#8220;File Cabinet&#8221; at Keep It and see how it feels.

**Update** I don&#8217;t think Keep It is for me. While I like how it looks and it _feels_ good, there are a few things I&#8217;m not sure I could live with&#8230;

  * No quick capture keyboard shortcut
  * No way to see un-filed items
  * No Markdown preview

I&#8217;ll keep an eye on it, but for now I&#8217;m sticking with my current tools.
