    A few notes about differences between TiddlyWiki and Roam related to my daily note taking process.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In October, 2018, I created a wiki at <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.org/">rudimentarylathe.org</a> using the wonderful <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. Since then I&#8217;ve written just shy of 1,000 "tiddlers" there and it&#8217;s been a totally pleasant experience.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The original intent of the wiki was to record notes about things or topics that interested me. I planned to keep notes on "Photography" or "Apple" or "Writing" or whatever. And while I do still create notes for topics, what ended up happening is that the whole thing turned into a sort of blog. The majority of new tiddlers were daily journal entries.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TiddlyWiki is amazing. Having everything in a single HTML file is simple and comforting and as future-proof as anything. It&#8217;s flexible and extendible. It has been a great tool for keeping public notes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And then, a few weeks ago, I learned about <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam from Roam Research</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I try pretty much every new note-taking tool I run into, so I created a private Roam database and started using it for random notes. Roam presents a "Daily Notes" page for today&#8217;s date right off the bat, so that&#8217;s where I enter notes by default. Notes in Roam are created as outlines (similar to <a href="https://workflowy.com/">Workflowy</a>). I love outlines. I&#8217;ve used tools like <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> and <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Orgmode</a> for years. I work best in outlines.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What happens when writing in Roam is that you link words with double square brackets. This is also how wikis like TiddlyWiki work, so that&#8217;s not what makes Roam different. What makes Roam different is that simply linking a word with brackets automatically creates a page for that word or phrase. Most wikis I know of require me to specifically create a new page from a link if it doesn&#8217;t exist. This is an important difference, because what Roam also does is include backlinks to each reference. Automatically.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This means that I can just type notes wherever I happen to be in Roam and, by simply mentioning something, that note (and a link back) is included on the page being mentioned. Here&#8217;s an example of the [[<a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/jackbaty/page/Tn_PHaMMj">TiddlyWiki</a>]] page in my <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/jackbaty">public Roam database</a>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Notice that I haven&#8217;t actually taken any notes about TiddlyWiki on that page. What the screenshot shows is that I&#8217;ve mentioned TiddlyWiki a bunch of times, and it creates the page automatically and shows each reference, in context, with links back to where the mention happened.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This. Is. Amazing!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t think most people realize how insanely valuable automatic backlinking is. Tools like TheBrain get it, which is why I&#8217;ve used TheBrain for years. Proper backlink handling pays dividends and Roam does it very well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I can do backlinks in TiddlyWiki but not like this. It may be possible, but would require research and tweaking but Roam does it right out of the box.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Notice also the "1 Unlinked Reference to &#8216;TiddlyWiki&#8217;" line at the bottom. Roam tracks any use of the word and can show references those as well. There&#8217;s also an option to automatically link those references with the click of a button.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another way to reference content from one area to another is by using transclusion. In TiddlyWiki I can transclude the content from tiddler A in tiddler B and any changes made in A will automatically appear in B. This is a great way to collect small bits of information together. There are a couple of things about how TiddlyWiki handles transclusion that make it less useful to me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first is that there&#8217;s no easy way to jump to the original, source tiddler. I frequently see a tiddler that I want to edit, and so I click "Edit" just to find that the content I want to change is actually transcluded from a different tiddler. In order to get there I have to search for the title of the original to find it, then I can edit that one. There&#8217;s also no indication that content is being transcluded. This is fine, but I&#8217;d prefer transcluded content to be indicated as such.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The second issue with transclusion in TiddlyWiki is that if I rename the source tiddler, transclusion breaks, and there&#8217;s nothing on the target tiddlers indicating anything is amiss. I&#8217;ve ended up with nearly empty tiddlers due to this.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Roam handles transclusion by showing the transcluded text in a different style. I can transclude just a single node on any page rather than the entire page. Roam shows a count of times a node has been transcluded and will display them in the sidebar by clicking a small button. Super handy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Speaking of renaming, in TiddlyWiki, renaming a tiddler breaks existing links. It warns me about it, but I still need to fix references.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In Roam I can rename pages at will, without worrying about breaking links. This is huge because it completely removes any friction around naming things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TiddlyWiki has all sorts of cool functions for collecting and manipulating notes. Roam doesn&#8217;t expose anything like this yet, but I&#8217;ve seen hints of a pretty powerful set of tools just under the surface. I expect these tools to expand and become generally available at some point.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So what does all this mean? I&#8217;m not sure yet, but, as of today I&#8217;m putting all of my private notes and most of my public ones in Roam rather than in TiddlyWiki.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is risky because Roam is quite new and TiddlyWiki has been around since 2004. Also, Roam is SaaS and TiddlyWiki is just an HTML file I can run locally, forever. There are privacy concerns to consider with Roam as well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, Roam feels like it will pay higher dividends than TiddlyWiki over the long term (assuming there is a long term). I prefer writing in outlines, and I love the way it handles backlinking and not worrying about naming things. Roam feels a little like using a modern spin on Orgmode in the browser.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s see where this goes. You can follow along in my public Roam database.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Update February 07, 2020: Keep an eye on TiddlyBlink, which aims to replicate many of Roams features.
