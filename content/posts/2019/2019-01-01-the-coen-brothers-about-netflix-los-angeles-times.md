[From Josh Rottenberg&#8217;s interview with the Coens, Los Angeles Times][1]:

> &#8230;the more fundamental thing is that [Netflix are] the people who are stepping up and spending money on movies that aren’t Marvel comic movies or big action franchise movies and that type of thing, which is pretty much the business of the studios now. We can’t argue with that.
