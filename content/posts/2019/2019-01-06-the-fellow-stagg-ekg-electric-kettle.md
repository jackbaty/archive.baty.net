I&#8217;m far from being a coffee snob, but I am a sucker for beautiful, functional everyday objects, and I fell hard for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fellowproducts.com/stagg-ekg/" target="_blank">Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettle</a>.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-06_stagekg.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2302" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-06_stagekg.jpg 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-01-06_stagekg-300x242.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption>Fellow Stagg EKG electric kettle</figcaption></figure> 

Counter space is precious, and I avoid things that need to be left out. The Stagg, though, is nice enough to justify the space. It sits there looking more like a sculpture than an appliance.

I love that it uses actual, physical, switches and knobs. I think we could all use more real knobs.

I also love the entire [&#8220;pour-over&#8221; system][1] from Fellow<figure class="wp-block-image">

Coming from a Chemex and basic stove-top kettle, the Stagg has been quite an improvement. Water heats faster, with precision. Pouring is delicate and controllable. The filtering happens more quickly. I love the funnel, serving markings, and drip catcher. I make 2 cups, and the second cup stays hot in the double-walled glass carafe while I drink the first cup.

I like coffee, but I&#8217;ve never thought too much about it. Suddenly, I&#8217;ve started to care. The entire process of making a cup of coffee has become delightful, so I&#8217;m thinking about where I can go from here.
