My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2906266669">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
It was fine. More like "Ready Player Six", I'd say.<br /><br />I enjoy the occasional pop culture reference, but good lord that was a lot of them.<br /><br />I knew I was in trouble when, as soon as he met a girl, I said to myself, "How much you bet he accidentally says something clever and they kiss before the day is out.", and whaddaya know. Of course that's what happened.<br /><br />Also, "The Last Starfighter" and "Enders Game" did this already, and arguably better. Still, it was a quick, mildly entertaining read.<br />
