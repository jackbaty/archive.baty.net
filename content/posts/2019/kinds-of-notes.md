- Current notes. Need to be immediately useful, searched, organized, edited, and "around"
- Logs. Easy to capture and search later. No need to edit. Appearance doesn't matter
- Ongoing notes. Notes on topics that I come back to over time. 
- Disposable notes. Stuff I need for a short time and never plan to use again.

Monolithic vs individual files?
