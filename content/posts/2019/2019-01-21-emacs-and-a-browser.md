I was [thinking
earlier](https://rudimentarylathe.org/#2019.01.21%20-%20Possible%20experiment%3A%20Emacs%20and%20a%20browser)
about trying to get by with only Emacs and a browser.

How much of my general daily computer work[^photos] could be done primarily with those
two apps? Not enough, but it's a fun thought experiment that
may turn into a real experiment.

After a quick pass through my Applications folder, here are the apps I
(currently) consider _must_ haves...

- Emacs
- Firefox
- Messages (Apple)
- 1Password (but 1Password X might not count as a separate app)
- Preview (I'm constantly dealing with PDFs and haven't gotten
  comfortable doing that with Emacs yet)
- TextExpander (I _could_ go without it, but I don't want to)
- iTerm (because command-line apps don't count as "Apps" so I cheat
  with this)
- Finder (I'm not sure this counts as an App, though)
- Keybase

So what does this
long list-that-contains-way-more-than-just-emacs-and-a-browser mean I
leave behind?

- DEVONthink
- Tinderbox
- TheBrain
- Bear
- Apple Notes
- MarsEdit
- BBEdit
- iA Writer
- Calendar
- Day One
- MacVim
- MailMate

I may try it for a few days and see what happens.
