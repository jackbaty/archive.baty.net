[Mike Johnston on shopping, The Online Photographer](https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2019/01/reflexive-shopping.html):

> I wonder if people ever start shopping for one thing and then shop themselves into something entirely different, and then find themselves placidly regarding the lovely thing they just bought while it slowly dawns on them that it's perfect except for one thing, which is that it isn't at all what they need. And that whatever they needed, they still need. I'm not saying that's ever happened to me, but I could see it.

I'm sure I have no idea what he's talking about.

Update, 3 hours later: I just ordered a Billingham Hadly Pro, Small, in black.
