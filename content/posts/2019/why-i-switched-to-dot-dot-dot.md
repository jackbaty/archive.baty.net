I could write a post every day titled "Why I switched to [INSERT TOOL HERE]."

I don't do that, because 90% of the time the reasons I switch from one tool to another have little to do with how I'd characterize them in a blog post. In other words, most of my "reasons" for switching, while based on facts, are still bullshit[^fn:1].

See, most of the time I'm just bored and want to try something new.

I rarely try new things when I'm actually busy or productive. I can be productive with any text editor at all. Or any todo manager, or any git client, or any browser, or any shell, or any terminal, or any operating system, or any blogging system, or any image editor, or any keyboard, or any camera, or any film developer, or... you see what I mean.

I do like to try new things, and if I'm being honest, there are only 3 reasons I switch tools:

1.  Boredom
2.  Procrastination
3.  Curiosity

Everything else is rationalization[^fn:2].

Update: [Karl Voit](https://karl-voit.at/) has [posted a followup](https://karl-voit.at/2019/08/29/switching-tools/) with some additional thoughts.

[^fn:1]: This doesn't mean I'll _never_ write about it!
[^fn:2]: I'm of course speaking for myself here.
