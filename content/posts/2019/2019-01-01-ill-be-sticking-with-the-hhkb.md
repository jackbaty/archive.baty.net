I thought I&#8217;d try a 60%, split layout keyboard, so I ordered an [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard][1]

TL;DR I&#8217;m not keeping it.

The split layout isn&#8217;t for me. It feels like one more thing to adjust and I&#8217;m not sold on the ergonomic advantages. I&#8217;ve been using a [Happy Hacking Keyboard][2] for a while and [I love it][3]. I&#8217;m not even sure why I tried anything else. Probably because the UHK is so damn customizable. I tried customizing it every way I could think of but nothing felt right. Also, I&#8217;m sure that having to switch between UHK and HHKB layouts between work and home would drive me nuts.

And I just can&#8217;t get over how much I _love_ the HHKB&#8217;s Topre switches.

So I bought a second HHKB and that settles it.
