[Moving WebWord > Trouble in Paradise: Problems Facing the Usability Community][1]

John Rhodes from Webword incited a riot among usability professionals with this article from October. He makes some valid points. For example:
  


> The better you do usability, the less it is understood, and the less value it seems to produce. Imagine that you make a problem go away. Who notices? No one. It is human nature to bitch and to complain. If things are going well, you don't think about them. If your car is in great working order, you probably don't think much about it. Oh sure, you care that it gets you from Point A to Point B, but you don't really care how. But, when it breaks down, you really care. The same can be said of usability. In many cases, the better you do it the less people care because you solved the problem. And, it seems like voodoo.</p>
