**Freenet &#8211; what for, exactly?**

So, I was toying around with [Freenet][1] for a few hours last night, trying to "get it." I think I get it, but I'm not sure I'm "with it." Ian Clark continues to talk about his reason for creating Freenet as being the Freedom of Speech. So far, it's so difficult to deal with that only software pirates, pedophiles, and geeks like me will benefit. I don't think that freedom of speech is an issue if no-one can figure out how to listen. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea (although of course I would **never** use a tool like this to download "protected" material), so maybe when/if it's searchable it will make more sense. In the meantime, I'll just be over here checking the status of the latest Napster transfer&#8230;
