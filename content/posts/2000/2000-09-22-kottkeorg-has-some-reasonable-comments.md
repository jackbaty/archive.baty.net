kottke.org has some [reasonable comments][1] about the [flash usability challenge][2].
  


Trouble is, the whole Flash Usability arguments aren't really fair for the Flash folks. Flash developers are forced to use a tool that makes it difficult to create usable products to begin with. Besides, it's too much fun to just "make cool stuff". It's also too easy to sell. The Gee Whiz Factor is still getting in the way.
  


I think I'd like to develop a basic html form in Flash which talk to a server somewhere running ColdFusion/ASP/PHP &#8211; whatever. Although doing the same thing using DHTML would probably be just as effective and a lot less time-consuming. Hmmm.
