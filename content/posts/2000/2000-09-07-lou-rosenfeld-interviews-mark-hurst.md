[Lou Rosenfeld interviews Mark Hurst][1]

Lou Rosenfield (author of Information Architecture for the World Wide Web and general architecture guru) interviews Mark Hurst of Creative Good. They discuss (rather heatedly) the differences and similarities between Information Architecture/Usability Engineering and the Customer Experience. It's a bit long, but mostly worth the effort.
