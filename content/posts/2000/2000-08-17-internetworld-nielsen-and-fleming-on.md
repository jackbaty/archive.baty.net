[internetworld: Nielsen and Fleming on Barnes and Nobles new site][1]

Nielsen: "BN.com has a small set of appropriate tabs with products that complement each other (unlike Amazon's tabs for lawn mowers, kitchen sinks, and other products unrelated to books). The very first page view is the bookstore with a big search box in the middle of the screen. In contrast, when you type <http://www.amazon.com> you get an irrelevant page that requires an extra click to get to the books. The default search box is off to the side, which makes it hard to search for books."
