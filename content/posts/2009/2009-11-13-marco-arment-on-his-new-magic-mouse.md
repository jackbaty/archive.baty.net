Marco Arment on Apple's Magic Mouse:

> "But it comes with a cost. Setting the auto-unlock wheel mode requires the Logitech software, which screws with the standard OS X pointer sensitivity and scrolling acceleration. To get mine to work the way it should, I had to install Logitech's software to enable the auto-unlock wheel, uninstall it, and install SteerMouse instead to enable most other functionality."

He describes my experience \_exactly\_. I love the MX. Best mouse I'd ever used, but the new Magic Mouse is better. Smaller, simpler, works. Buying a second one for the house this weekend.
