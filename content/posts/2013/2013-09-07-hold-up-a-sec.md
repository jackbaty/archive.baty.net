I've always been an early adopter. Trying the latest gadgets is practically my specialty. Software, computers, phones, music, cameras, all of it. The excitement of new-shiny draws me in every time. It's fun to try cool new stuff. I don't even bother asking why I need whatever nifty device I just preordered; I just order it because it's going to be better. Right?

On the other hand, I spend a lot of time using very old technology; things like manual typewriters, vinyl records, film cameras, etc. One reason for that is certainly nostalgia. I miss being wherever I was and with whomever I was with back then. Probably. 

But there's more to it than simply nostalgia. Using old technology reminds me to stop and say "Hey, hold up a sec. I'm not sure this new thing is actually _better_ than what we had before." In many cases, newer is better. That's obvious. But there are _aspects_ of older things that are lost in the name of convenience. For me, those aspects make the inconvenience worth the hassle. A few random examples I thought of today:

  * The tale told by books on a bookshelf 
  * Deliberately, physically choosing a record to play
  * The sound of a typewriter
  * The permanence and personality of handwritten notes
  * Choosing just the right ink for a fountain pen
  * Truly owning my music
  * Lending out a favorite book
  * The magic of a photograph emerging in the darkroom chemicals
  * The feel of a high quality film camera
  * The rush of dropping a love letter into the mailbox

All of these things have been replaced by lesser, more convenient versions. Newer isn't always better.
