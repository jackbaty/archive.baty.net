As Nick Cave's co-conspirator with The Birthday Party, Rowland S. Howard should not have remained unknown to me for so long. Today I discovered his first solo record, "Teenage Snuff Film."

I love hearing wonderful things for the first time. Howard's guitar work is terrific and the songs are dark and moody and depressing and awesome.
