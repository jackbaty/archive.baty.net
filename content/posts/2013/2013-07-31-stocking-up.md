            Too often lately I read about the demise of yet another film. Prices keep going up as availability goes down. In order to help stave off any imminent film shortages, I've begun stocking up on my favorite emulsions.

            I'm not in a hurry, since I think we've got a few years yet before things really start slimming down, but I do want to start planning. What I've done is given myself a monthly film budget. I spend the same amount on film each month regardless of how much I've actually shot. The budget is higher than my burn rate so I net out with more than I started with each month. Over time this will provide a freezer full of film that should last a lifetime. My lifetime, anyway.
