What I usually say is that I just don't care for photographs using artificial light (flash). What I usually mean, however, is that I just don't understand how to use flash to make interesting photographs. Basically, it's a copout. 

I'm slowly trying to change that. 

The above image of Zim was taken with a new (to me) Hasselblad 503CXi and the Hasselblad D-Flash 40. Not terribly convenient, but with simple TTL operation I can get some practice without having to over-think everything. The rig looks like this&#8230; 

                <div>
                    <img alt="Hasselblad 503CXi with D-Flash 40" src="/img/imported/503CXi-with-flash.jpg">
                </div>
    
    
    
            <div>
                <div><p>Hasselblad 503CXi with D-Flash 40</p></div>
            </div>
    

Yes, it's a monster. I'm probably going to need a proper bracket, but for now this works.  I still may not know how to make an interesting image using Flash, but it's not going to be for lack of trying.
