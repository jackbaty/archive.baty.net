After hearing from several people that they don't visit my site because I have "too many places I post things," I've decided to heed their advice and move things around again in hopes of making things easier for everyone.&nbsp;

To that end, I've stopped posting to this /photography/ section and moved everything up to the main [jackbaty.com][1] area (aka /blog/). I don't get enough traffic for it to affect too many people, and I hope this will be better for those few who do visit.&nbsp;
