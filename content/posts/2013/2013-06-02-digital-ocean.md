There have been so many positive comments about DigitalOcean that I couldn't resist having a go, so you're soaking in it right now.

Baty.net is a static site so moving it to a DigitalOcean "Droplet" was easy. Droplets are KVM-based Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and start at $5/month for an instance with 512MB RAM and 20GB of storage. The kicker is that the storage is all on SSD drives. 

If you decide to try it, use the link below and I get a small commission.
