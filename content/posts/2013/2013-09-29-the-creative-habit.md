Twyla Tharp's "_[The Creative Habit][1]_" is pretty much as helpful as most other creative "self-help" books; meaning it wasn't terribly helpful. I found her approach interesting and it raised my curiousity about dance, but telling me that you're a relentless perfectionist workaholic doesn't help me become one. I'm not sure I'd even want to.
