<span class="drop_cap">D</span>avid Foster Wallace has killed himself. He was 46 years old &#8211; my age, basically. There are very few writers whose work I seek out with a vengeance. Wallace was one of those writers. It started with \_Infinite Jest\_, that enormous and painful monster which took me a year to finish. Since then I've read everything he's written that I know of. Hell, there are times I want to \_be\_ DFW. He was brilliant, funny, diverse, hip to a fault and it's a terrible, terrible thing that he's gone.

Anyone for a game of Eschaton?
