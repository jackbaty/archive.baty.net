title: Yes Doctor, it&#039;s an iphone

I've been feeling a bit wonky for a week or so. Tonight It got uncomfortable enough to consider asking a doctor or two to about it. The Internet said I had several symptoms of a heart attack so better safe than sorry, eh?

So here I am. Wired up to monitors, oxygen tube up my nose for the past 4 hours. EKG looked fine. Bloodwork pending. Just had an ultrasound to check my gall bladder I think.

This is one of those better-safe-than-sorry things but I still feel mighty silly.

The cool thing is that I can write this on my iphone while I wait for them to let me go home
