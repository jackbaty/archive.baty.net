<span class="drop_cap">G</span>iant crocodiles terrorizing a group of tourists wouldn't normally warrant a rental, but "Rogue":http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1173563-rogue/ got good reviews, and I'm in a B-movie sort of kick so I gave it a shot. Glad I did. Nothing groundbreaking, but things moved along nicely without too much over-the-top silliness to ruin it. Recommended.
