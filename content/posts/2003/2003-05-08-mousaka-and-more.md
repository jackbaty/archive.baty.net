Spent the evening with Mary in Detroit’s Greektown – a first for me. We ate at Hellas. Never having eaten Greek food before, I had no idea what to expect. It was fantastic. My favorite was the Octopus – we ordered seconds. Then came Mousaka, some Saganaki and Grape leaves. (Didn’t care for the grape leaves.) We had 3 different desserts – Baklava, rice pudding and some custard thingy which was awesome.
