We were talking today about the [Wired article on synthetic diamonds][1]. I've never been a big fan of the diamond industry's (aka the De Beers cartel) tactics. Anil Dash, back in January, does a [pretty good job of explaining][2] why we can do without the current diamond "industry."

In response to a print ad&#8230;
  


> "Want your materialistic, easily-misled wife to stop being such a frigid bitch? Buy her a diamond! Did your husband decide to increase your consumer debt in order to buy you a pair of earrings that were mined at gunpoint by children in Africa? Reward him with grudging sex and a temporary cessation of your relentless nagging!"
