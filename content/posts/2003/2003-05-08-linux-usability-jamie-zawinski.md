Jamie Zawinski writes, or rants actually, about Linux usability. He's right.
  


"So I gave up on that, and tried to install gstreamer (<http://gstreamer.net/>). Get this. Their propose &#8216;solution' for distributing binaries on Red Hat systems? They point you at an RPM that installs apt, the Debian package system! Yeah, that's a good idea, I want to struggle with two competing packaging systems on my machine just to install a single app. Well, I found some RPMs for Red Hat 7.2, but apparently they expect you to have already rectally inserted Gnome2 on that 7.2 system first. Uh, no. I've seen the horror of Red Hat 8.0, and there's no fucking way I'm putting Gnome2 on any more of my machines for at least another six months, maybe a year."</p>
