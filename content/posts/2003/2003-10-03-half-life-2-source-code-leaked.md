title: Half-life 2 source code leaked

Seems as if the [Half-Life 2 source code has been leaked][1] after someone comprimised a number of machines on Valve's network. Bad news for Valve, who've always been community oriented. That very community is in the process of hunting down and killing the culprit(s). I sure wouldn't want to piss off thousands of hardcore gamers just waiting to play some real-life online seek and destroy.
