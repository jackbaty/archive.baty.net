Via [Joel on Software][1] comes word of [tokens][2], a method of sending large files or folders of files through email. Looks like a very nice implementation, but $49.00 is the wrong price point for it to, as Joel says, "take off like wildfire." And another thing, the [Creo website][3] bears a striking resemblance to many of the early designs of [fusionary.com][4].
