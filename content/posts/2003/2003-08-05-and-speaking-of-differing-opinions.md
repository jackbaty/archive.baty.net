&#8230;Nearly 50% of the CNET reviews of Firebird are negative. I suspect that most of these are based upon earlier versions which, to be honest, were a bit buggy. Too bad I can't call those folks up and explain to them that the reason some of their favorite sites look like shit in Firebird is that they were designed badly, using completely nonsensical HTML so that the popular, broken browser could display them properly.
