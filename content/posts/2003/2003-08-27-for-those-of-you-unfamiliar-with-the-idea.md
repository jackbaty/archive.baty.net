From Jason Kottke in a [post][1] on stop design's site:
  


> &#8230;semantics with regard to web design means that if you have a paragraph, surround it with <p> tags; if you&rsquo;ve got a article title (or something), use an <h1> tag; and if you have a list of items, use <ul> or <ol> with <li> tags instead of separating them with breaks or using <div>s. As much as possible, the tags surrounding the content of a document should describe what that content is and/or what it&rsquo;s for.
