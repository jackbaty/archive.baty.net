Paul Graham's article, [A Plan for Spam][1] is a great read for anyone interested in ridding their inbox of unwanted messages. It also sparked a flurry of tools using Bayesian Filtering statistically filter spam. I set up [Bogofilter][2] and after only about 10 hours, it's been catching almost everything. What it misses, Spamassassin catches and then updates the "bogosity" of the message so it gets caught next time.
