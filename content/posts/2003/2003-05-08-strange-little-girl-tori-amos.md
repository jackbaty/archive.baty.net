Saw Tori Amos last night here in town. Every time she's been here in
  

  
the past, I've told myself that I wasn't going to miss her show. Then
  

  
promptly missed her show. Glad I didn't this time. She has an amazing
  

  
voice, writes great songs and put on a fine show. Hand me my leather.
