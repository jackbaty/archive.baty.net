This ties in so closely to some of the issues we've been dealing with at
  

  
the office, and points out where I should be focused while sharpening my
  

  
user experience discussion skills. Learning to make better paper
  

  
prototypes or finding better ways to recruit test users may not be
  

  
nearly as valuable as the ability to teach clients to recognize the
  

  
benefits of user experience work. Teach them to fish.
