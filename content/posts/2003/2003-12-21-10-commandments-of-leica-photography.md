I want a Leica. Do I have to have a reason? Okay, so far the best one I can come up with is the Philadelphia Leica User Group's [The Ten Commandments of Leica Photography][1]



  1. Thy children are ugly. Do not make us look upon them.
  2. Thou shalt not have a photograph entitled "Pop-Pop" in your Leica portfolio.
  3. Thou shalt not photograph thy dog ,nor thy cat, nor thy ass.
  4. Photographing in exotic locals does not makeith thou a great photographer. (it makest thou a tourist)
  5. Thou shalt not photograph buildings.
  6. Thou shalt not photograph statues.
  7. Thou shalt not photograph homeless people. (Leave them alone or buy them food. This pleaseth the Lord.)
  8. Thou shalt not photograph people from behind and call it street photography. (This maketh thou a coward.)
  9. Thou shalt not own stupid Leica gadgets.
 10. Thou shalt not brag about the sharpness of thy lens, nor the number of Summicron's thou hast acquired, nor the freshness of thy rear-cap, nor the dinglessness of thy bottom plate.

Incidentally, Kyle Cassidy (a PLUG member) wrote a [nifty piece about the Canonet][2] that's helping me get through Leica Lust.
