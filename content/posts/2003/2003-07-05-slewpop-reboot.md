It's no suprise to anyone that I love [RSS Aggregators][1]. One of
  

  
the reasons is that some weblogs are only posted to rarely, and it's
  

  
not easy remembering to check in and find out when something has been
  

  
updated. Such is the case with Steve's [Slewpop][2].&nbsp; His most recent
  

  
entry is simply a note that says he's "rebooting" slewpop and bringing
  

  
it back more focused, although he doesn't say on what he intends to
  

  
focus. While a great idea, especially if you know Steve, it made me
  

  
think about weblogs and focus in general.&nbsp; Do blogs need focus? I'd
  

  
like to think that they don't &#8211; they only need to be interesting. This
  

  
is assuming that the blogger gives a shit about his readers. Many
  

  
don't, and that's okay too. I read some blogs that are all over the
  

  
map. But they're fun to read. Others **are** focused and I learn quite a
  

  
lot because of it. Some are both.

It boils down to voice. If people like your voice, they'll ready you. If
  

  
not, they'll find something else to read. Personally, I love it that
  

  
some folks enjoy reading this weblog, but if others don't, so be it.&nbsp; I
  

  
hope Steve finds his voice.
