title: No RSS Feed, No Read

I read a large and growing number of weblogs every day, but only
  

  
through RSS feeds. I don't want to visit one or two hundred sites,
  

  
looking for new posts, so I don't. It is becoming apparent that if
  

  
your blog doesn't have a feed, I'll rarely read it. With the recent
  

  
proliferation of software like [RSSBandit][1],

[SharpReader][2]
  

  
and [Syndirella][3], it's
  

  
getting better and easier. In fact, using SharpReader today, with its
  

  
visually pleasing and familiar 3-paned interface, I feel like I'm
  

  
reading news and mailing lists, but only seeing posts by authors I'm
  

  
interested in.&nbsp; I'm surely not the only one who feels this way. The
  

  
moral is, if you want your blog to be read, publish a feed.
