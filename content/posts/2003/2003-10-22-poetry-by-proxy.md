A Thousand Kisses Deep Leonard Cohen

The ponies run, the girls are young, 

The odds are there to beat. 

You win a while, and then it's done 

Your little winning streak. 

And summoned now to deal 

With your invincible defeat, 

You live your life as if it's real, 

A Thousand Kisses Deep.

I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, 

I'm back on Boogie Street. 

You lose your grip, and then you slip 

Into the Masterpiece. 

And maybe I had miles to drive, 

And promises to keep: 

You ditch it all to stay alive, 

A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow, 

The wretched and the meek, 

We gather up our hearts and go, 

A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Confined to sex, we pressed against 

The limits of the sea: 

I saw there were no oceans left 

For scavengers like me. 

I made it to the forward deck. 

I blessed our remnant fleet 

And then consented to be wrecked, 

A Thousand Kisses Deep.

I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed, 

I'm back on Boogie Street. 

I guess they won't exchange the gifts 

That you were meant to keep. 

And quiet is the thought of you, 

The file on you complete, 

Except what we forgot to do, 

A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow, 

The wretched and the meek, 

We gather up our hearts and go, 

A Thousand Kisses Deep.

The ponies run, the girls are young, 

The odds are there to beat . . .
