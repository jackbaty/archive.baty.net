Editors. I try them all, so now I'm trying [Nova](https://nova.app).

The idea of a freshly-built, all-native macOS text/code editor is exciting. I think people overreact to the oddities of Electron apps, but a fast, lean, "real" Mac app is still refreshing.

I have only used Nova for about an hour, including to write this post, but my first impression is that it's fast, clean, pretty, and a pleasant, more Mac-like alternative to VS Code.
