I don't like having so many subscriptions, but I'm losing interest in maintaining servers and apps, so I'm now using the [Commento](https://commento.io)- hosted version instead of the self-hosted version for comments.

I've looked at other options but I don't love any of them, so I'm sticking with Commento for now. My new theme supports it out of the box, so all it took was for me to pay for a subscription and now Commento is managing comments for me for the next year.

With any luck I won't have to think about comments here for a while. 

Feel free to comment below! 😝
