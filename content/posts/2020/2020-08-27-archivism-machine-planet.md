[Dante Stella | The Machine Planet](https://themachineplanet.wordpress.com/2020/08/27/archivism-immortalitas-vel-non/):

> The real danger is not time, or technology, or the elements, or phlogiston. The real danger is that the work will fall into the hands of someone with no interest in it

> You might find in the end that your time and money is better spent on life experiences than making the record of it last just a couple more years longer. If you do good work and give it meaning, people will find a way to preserve it.

I spend a lot of time worrying about the longevity of my photos. Maybe it's a waste of time.
