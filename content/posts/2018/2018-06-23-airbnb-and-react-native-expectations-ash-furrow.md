[Ash Furrow][1]:

> The reasons that Airbnb chose to move away from React Native are cultural as much as they are technical, and while I understand why they didn’t publicize these tensions, it gives the impression that Airbnb’s decision was based entirely in technical merit. And that’s just not the case. 

I love reading about people&#8217;s decisions when it comes to technology choices. And also the _reactions_ to those decisions.
