I&#8217;m not a person who normally uses dark themes, but with all the hoopla around Dark Mode in Mojave I thought I should try it for a month and see if I liked it as much as everyone else seemed to.

Nope, I don&#8217;t like Dark Mode.

I guess one person&#8217;s &#8220;eye bleach&#8221; is another person&#8217;s &#8220;proper contrast and color&#8221; 🙂

When I switched back to Light Mode (or &#8220;Normal Mode&#8221; as I like to call it), I felt a sense of relief. Dark Mode just felt too heavy-handed.

Mac apps already tend to look very similar. There&#8217;s a list of things in a sidebar on the left, detail on the right. Sometimes something else in the center. Dark Mode seems to make this worse. Mail, DEVONthink, MarsEdit, etc. all seem to blend into a single pile of exactly the same-looking things. Also, small dialog windows tended to get lost for some reason. I&#8217;d think a file copy was finished but nope, the progress window was just difficult to see.

Anyway, I&#8217;m happy for all the people who&#8217;ve been looking forward to a system-wide dark mode, but I&#8217;ll be keeping it light.
