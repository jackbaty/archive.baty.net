Is there such a thing as an addiction to &#8220;being on the computer&#8221;? If there is, I suffer from it.

I sit here staring at a screen for hours with no real goal or plan. I just click things and read things and move things around.

Eventually, I&#8217;ll get bored and &#8220;go do something&#8221; but that doesn&#8217;t last long. The whole time I&#8217;m off doing things in the real world I&#8217;m thinking about getting back to the computer.

It can&#8217;t be healthy.

For a while, I was pretty good at following my &#8220;no computer after 7:00pm&#8221; rule. I&#8217;d go write in my journal or read a book or take a walk. For the past few months I&#8217;ve ignored that rule completely. I mean, I&#8217;m trying to get better at Photoshop so I&#8217;ve _gotta_ put the time in, right?

Something needs to change.

I&#8217;m thinking of starting with some sort of computer fasting routine. Maybe I&#8217;ll work on bringing back the &#8220;no computer after 7:00pm&#8221; rule and the long-neglected &#8220;no computer after 1:00pm on Sundays&#8221; rule.

I&#8217;ve ordered a copy of Ryder Carroll&#8217;s new [Bullet Journal Method book][1] hoping it will help inspire me to bring paper back into my day.

Right now I&#8217;m going to go outside and take a walk.
