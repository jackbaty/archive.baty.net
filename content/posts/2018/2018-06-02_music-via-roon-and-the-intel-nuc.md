I have been using [Roon](https://roonlabs.com) to manage and play my music collection and it's
wonderful.

I wrote a little about my first impressions [here](/2018/the-roon-music-player-is-awesome/). In fact, I like it
so much that I paid the $499 fee for a lifetime subscription. This seems steep
only until you consider it as a critical component of an audio system. (See how
I rationalize?).

For the first couple of weeks I ran Roon "Core", the brains of the system, on my
iMac. This worked fine, but I wanted to offload the processing and storage
to a dedicated device.

Enter [Roon Optimized Core Kit](https://kb.roonlabs.com/Roon_Optimized_Core_Kit), which is a custom Linux build (RoonServer)
created specifically to run Roon Core on your own hardware. In my case, that
hardware is the [Intel NUC7i3BNH](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4EOJNG/). The NUC is a tiny, headless, silent server
perfect for running ROCK.

All of my music is stored on the NUC's internal SSD drive. I don't have a large
library, but if I run out of room, I can easily plug one or more larger USB
drives into the NUC and tell Roon Core where the music is stored on them. Roon
manages all of my music regardless of where it's stored. When I buy new music
I only need to copy the files to the shared Roon drive and it's automatically
sorted, indexed, and fed into Roon's music database.

The Roon Core software running on the NUC is managed via a web control panel.
Once the initial installation is done, everything can be done headlessly.
Updates to ROCK are done right within the Player app. Considering several moving
parts, some rather technical, this has all worked flawlessly so far.

Using Roon, I can easily control all of my music, stored anywhere, using any
device, and play it on any combination of HomePod, Sonos, and dedicated
amplifier. If I get bored with my own music collection, Roon's integration with
the [Tidal streaming music service](http://tidal.com/us) gives me access to any music I could ever
want, using the same system.

It's pretty great.
