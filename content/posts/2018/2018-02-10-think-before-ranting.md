The first draft of my earlier [rant about images on blog posts][1] used the following screenshot as an example:

<img src="/img/2018/02/andy-sparks-header-image-2.png" alt="Andy sparks header image" title="andy-sparks-header-image.png" border="0" width="537" height="600" />

The screenshot is of a [Medium post by Andy Sparks][2] about his new service, [Holloway][3], (which looks awesome, by the way).

Poking around the Holloway site, I found the [About page][4], on which was the photograph from the Medium post, with the following caption:

> A holloway is an old English term for a sunken lane arising from centuries of use.

Whoops. While I still don&#8217;t think the image was _necessary_, it&#8217;s certainly not irrelevant. So I guess I&#8217;m saying that it&#8217;s wise to do at least a modicum of research before complaining about something. I&#8217;m glad I changed the post before publishing, but it was a reminder to be careful what I bitch about and how I bitch about it. Also, maybe I should take my own advice about just not ranting at all.
