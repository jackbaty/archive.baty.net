_[Huy Tran][1]_

> Spacemacs is the first Emacs version I used, so I&#8217;m kind of attached to the evil-mode and SPC mnemonic key binding.But I always have a feeling that something is not right, Spacemacs hides a lot of things under the hood, and it loads a lot of stuff that I do not need during the startup.

This is so tempting.
