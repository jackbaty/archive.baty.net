The [IPTC Metadata Standard][1] defines the &#8220;Title&#8221; attribute like this:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    A shorthand reference for the digital image. Title provides a short human readable name which can be a text and/or numeric reference. It is not the same as Headline. Enter a short verbal and human readable name for the image, this may be the file name
  </p>
</blockquote>

And here&#8217;s the definition of &#8220;Headline&#8221;:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    A brief synopsis of the caption. Headline is not the same as Title. Enter a brief publishable synopsis or summary of the contents of the image
  </p>
</blockquote>

This to me says that gallery services like Flickr or Facebook should display the Headline field from uploaded photos, not the Title. They don&#8217;t, so I&#8217;ve had to resort to contortions in order to work both the way I think things _should_ work and the way they actually do work.

I give up. I&#8217;m now entering descriptive text in the Title field rather than the Headline. Hell, in Lightroom CC _there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;Headline&nbsp;field._ It&#8217;s turning out to be way easier to do it wrong like everyone else. Who knows, maybe I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s been wrong all along.
