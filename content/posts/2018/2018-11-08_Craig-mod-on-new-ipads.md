> The iPads of today are a far cry from that oddly rounded, difficult to hold, heavy, low-ish resolution first version of the iPad released in 2010. These new iPad Pros are, from a hardware perspective (whispering with hedged hyperbole), quite possibly the most impressive, certainly most beautiful, consumer computers ever made. And so expectations should be high for what we can do with them. We should expect to do more, more easily.

> Computers are nothing if not a constellation of design and engineering details that either work for or against you. They either push you forward, smoothly, an encouraging tailwind allowing you to get done the work you want to get done, or they push back, become abrasive, breaking you from flow states, causing you to have to Google even the simplest task. I lost an hour the other day trying to open an Open Office Document.10 This is bananas. iPads should be better. They’re so close. And they’re certainly powerful enough.
