The Finder in macOS has always been very simple. Too simple, really. I've tried
just about every replacement app I could find and all of them have come up short
in one way or another. If they're too simple, then why bother? If they're too
complicated they tend to be slow or cumbersome to use. Either way, they introduce
friction and just get in the way.

I've used [Cocoatech's Pathfinder](https://cocoatech.com) on and off for years
and it's a well-done and powerful app. Version 8 was recently released, adding a
ton of cool flexibility around "modules". Too much flexibility for me, I've found.

I started testing [Forklift by BinaryNights](https://binarynights.com) and I
think I may have found a Finder replacement with a usable level of complexity
that doesn't get in the way.

Here's why I like it:

- Remote connections. I use Transmit for heavy-duty remote file management but
  having a few frequently used servers right in Forklift's sidebar is handy
- Integration with command line tools. I can access command line scripts that
  act on selected files in Forklift. 
- Editing files in preview pane. I can select a text file and not only see the
  file's contents, but I can edit it right in place.
- Multi Rename. I rename files with consistent patterns all the time. With
  Forklift I can save them as presets and they're always right at hand.
- Creating files. I just want to create a new text file in whatever folder I'm
  viewing. There's a button in Forklift's toolbar for this.
- Viewing hidden files. I can easily toggle display of hidden files.
- Open in Terminal. There's a button that opens the current directory in iTerm.

All of these features are available in one form or another with other apps or
scripts, but Forklift puts them together in a nice, usable way that doesn't also
overcomplicate things when all I want to do is manage a few files.
