Releasing an entirely new, and almost entirely different editor in WordPress is A Big Deal, but I personally don&#8217;t care that much.

I edit using so many different editors, on web and desktop and mobile, that I&#8217;ve learned to deal with whatever&#8217;s there and be done with it. As long as one of [my][1] [favorite][2] [choices][3] isn&#8217;t readily available, that is.

It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens in six months once we&#8217;ve weeded out all of the &#8220;OMG! It&#8217;s too different, change it back!&#8221; reactions and people have settled down. At least I assume they&#8217;ll settle down, but&nbsp;¯\_(ツ)\_/¯.
