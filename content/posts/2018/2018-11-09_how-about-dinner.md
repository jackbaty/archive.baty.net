My ex-wife passed away recently. We'd been divorced for many years and haven't kept in touch, but we share a daughter, so we never completely lost touch.

While going through her mom's things, my daughter found the sign that started our whole relationship. I was working construction in her neighborhood at the time. She would drive by a few times a day and we'd make eye contact. Eventually, I gathered all the courage I could muster, wrote "HOW ABOUT DINNER" on the back of a blueprint, and held it up as she drove by. She stopped, and the rest is history.
