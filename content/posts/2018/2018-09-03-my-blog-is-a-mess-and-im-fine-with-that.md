I wonder how much time I&#8217;ve spent worrying about my various blogs. So much time, is how much.

Should I include short posts on the main timeline? Should I always use titles? Is it too cluttered if there&#8217;s a sidebar with recent posts and whatnot? Serif or no? Static HTML is cool, but I wonder if I should just make things easy and use WordPress.

It&#8217;s endless!

All of this is fun to think about, but I&#8217;ve sort of stopped worrying about the shape of things around here. I&#8217;ve posted whatever I&#8217;ve felt like posting to wherever I felt like posting it in whatever format I felt like at the time.

My writing has never been precise, why should my blog be? I play pretty fast and loose with content, so why should the blog be tidy and carefully considered? And who wants everything to look like a Medium post, anyway?

So yeah, it&#8217;s messy here. It&#8217;s inconsistent. It&#8217;s unfocused. I love it.
