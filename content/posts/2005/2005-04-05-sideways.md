I think Paul Giamatti may well be the best actor working today &#8211; or at least my favorite. And unless I'm mistaken he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. Well that's crap. He should've won for _American Splendor_ and he should've won for [Sideways][1]. You may have guessed that I just finished watching _Sideways_. It's well after midnight and I'm going to go back right now and watch it again. Maybe twice. Yep, it's that good &#8211; especially if you happen to be, as I am, forty(ish) and heading full-tilt toward a best-of-show midlife crisis.
