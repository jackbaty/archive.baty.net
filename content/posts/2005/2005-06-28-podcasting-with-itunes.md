I've been bitching about podcasting for as long as the word has existed. More specifically, my complaint centers around the way podcasting is typically done &#8211; by a geek or two who do nothing but wank on and on about the same boring crap that's on their weblogs. For a long time I thought that was all there was to it. This is changing, and now that Apple's [iTunes 4.9][1] has all sorts of podcasting goodness built in I'm slowly changing my tune. This could actually get interesting.
