The new Jack Johnson CD is housed in a fancy, very thin plastic case that is cool but ugly and impossible to use. No biggie, CD cases have been crappy and frustrating for years. There's nothing to see here. I then stumbled onto [Jewelboxing][1]. I love them without ever seeing one. Why? because it takes something mundane like a CD jewel case and tries making it exceptional. Don't underestimate the value in that.
