I have used, and mentioned here, some great web interfaces lately. As a counterpoint, I'd like to mention that using [Bloglines][1] is a terrible experience. I keep trying to like it, as a centralized collection of feeds is important, but it really is horrible. Since I'm not interested in the social aspects of the site, there's not enough there for me to suffer through it. I hope they someday make managing several hundred feeds less painful, or that someone points out the "use good interface" checkbox I've missed.
