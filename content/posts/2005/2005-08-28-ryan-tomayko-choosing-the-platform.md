From [lesscode.org][1], Ryan Tomayko almost accidentally chooses Ruby and Ruby on Rails&#8230;

I'm committed to my responsibilities on the Python projects I have going right now and I have a ton of existing applications and utilities written in Python that aren't going anywhere but Rails ganked 80% of my future code somehow. What's cool is that because I'm dealing with freedom languages, I don't feel like I have to make a single choice here because they work equally well in my environment (and most any environment). What's odd is that it wasn't Rails that finally pushed me over so much as Ruby and its mysterious perfectly placed support libraries and utilities."
