Last night I was browsing, reading feeds, generally minding my own business when I came across the [Roku SoundBridge][1]. I've known things like this existed, and for some time considered Apples Airport Express, but nothing really clicked. This clicked. I had an old Onkyo receiver that wasn't being used, so I dropped that in my bedroom, plugged in the SoundBridge to the analog jacks and fired her up. There was my shared iTunes library via wireless and rendevouz &#8211; instantly accessible. The joy is that it comes with a little remote so I don't have to be near the computer to manage what I'm listening to. It will also play internet radio directly, without needing iTunes running. Oh, and it looks cool, too. Pretty nifty, if you ask me.
