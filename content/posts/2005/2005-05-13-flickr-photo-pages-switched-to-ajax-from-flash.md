title: Flickr photo pages switched to Ajax (from Flash)

The photo pages on [Flickr][1] now use DHTML/Ajax to display images and notes. See [the this Flickr weblog post][2]. Photos were previously displayed using (an admittedly well-done) Flash app.

Given the recent fervor around Ajax, libraries making cross-browser scripting easier, and very nice implementations on sites like [Backpack][3] and now Flickr, I can't help but believe this is a trend that will gain momentum quickly.
