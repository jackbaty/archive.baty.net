[This post on 43Folders][1] reminded me of why sticking with David Allen's GTD is oh so worth the effort. It's not necessarily about getting _more_ things done, but rather about _how_ things get done &#8211; and being much less stressed about the process. Say it with me now; "**Much&#8230;less&#8230;stressed**." Aaaah.
