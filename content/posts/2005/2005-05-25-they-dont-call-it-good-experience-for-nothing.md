title: They don’t call it Good Experience for nothing

One thing I really love is when someone a lot smarter than me rants about **exactly** the same things I do, only better. Mark Hurst of [Good Experience][1] nails a bunch of em, and I'll summarize here, but be sure to read the short paragraph he adds to each of them.

Mark says: "These are things that NEED TO STOP:"

</p> 

  * Cell phones that make noise when they turn off.


  * Cell phones that require a password to check voice mail.


  * "Gray text is cooler." 


  * "Small text is cooler." 


  * "Non-underlined links are **way** kewl."
</ul> 

There are a few more, but these just so nail it that I thought I'd bring it up as a public service. If you're guilty of encouraging any of the above, stop it.
