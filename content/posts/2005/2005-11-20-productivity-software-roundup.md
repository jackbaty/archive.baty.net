I looked at my doc today and realized that the same half-dozen apps are almost always open. I thought I'd write a little about how I've been using each of them lately.</p> 

### [NovaMind][2]

NovaMind is a pure, lovely, and feature-rich mind mapping tool. After reading a few books and creating dozens of maps however, I'm using NovaMind less and less. It's a great app, but I'm finding that the single largest benefit of mind mapping for me is the spacial organization. I know that [Buzan][3] would be disappointed, but most of the "proper" techniques are lost on me. For simple spatial organization, combined with the ability to organize notes and create content, I find [Tinderbox][4] suits me better.

### [Tinderbox][5]

Tinderbox is an enigma. I first downloaded the demo a couple years ago and completely hated it. It looked funny and I had no idea what I was supposed to do with it. Trashed it. A few positive reviews can go a long way, so about a year ago I tried again. This time I was much more successful. As I'm known to do, I dove right in &#8211; creating agents and workflows and outlines and maps and prototypes and on and on. Things got complicated so quickly I became overwhelmed and eventually abandoned it for [DevonTHINK][6] out of panic more than anything else.

**Used For**

</p> 

  * Brainstorming. I love Mind Maps, but Buzan-esque maps (such as those created using NovaMind) are limited as to how much actual information they contain. Tinderbox's map view is a nice compromise: spacial orientation with the ability to nest and collect vast amounts of information all within a single document.


  * "Deep" outlining. For outlines which are all about hierarchy, OmniOutliner rules. However, deeper outlines containing boatloads of text and notes are better served with Tinderbox. It's a better writing tool.


  * Notetaking. Using a map view and a couple keys (Enter and Space) I can hammer out dozens of individual notes in no time. Then, they can be easily organized, rearranged, nested later.
</ul> 

This time around I'm only going to use Agents and other "advanced" features when I need them. Keep it simple, stupid. And I love the fact that there's no toolbar.

### [DevonTHINK][6]

DevonTHINK is the best information-hoarding-and-organizing tool there is. I don't use it as a content creation tool, but instead as an information gathering tool. It easily grabs anything I throw at it &#8211; text, web pages, images &#8211; and makes searching through it later a joy by autoclassifying and linking similar bits together. Pretty sweet.

### [OmniOutliner][7]

OmniOutliner is one of those things that never clicked with me. I **love** outliners, but always considered OmniOutliner to be a little too much &#8211; too, I don't know, fidgety.

So there I was, happily plodding along with [Hog Bay Notebook][8] and that's that. Along comes the [Kinkless GTD System][9], which is basically an OmniOutliner Pro document with a few AppleScripts thrown in. Since I pretty much live for Getting Things Done, I thought I'd give it a whirl. One hour later I'd ordered a copy of OOP and haven't looked back since. Actually using it for real work helped me to get past what I hadn't liked previously. Now, I think I "get it." OOP is a **great** outlining app, and Kinkless is the best GTD implementation I've tried (and I've tried _a lot_ of them).

### [Circus Ponies Notebook][10]

Circus Ponies Notebook has become my primary project documentation app. I keep a separate notebook for each project. Within each, are sections such as&#8230;

</p> 

  * Log &#8211; for documenting and keeping a date-based history of each project


  * Files &#8211; Dragging PDFs, MindMaps, Word docs and others into a notebook copies the document and stores it _inside_ the notebook. Makes it easier to find than using the filesystem or, God forbid, Spotlight.


  * Documentation &#8211; Project documentation and notes.
</ul> 

I also keep a Journal notebook around for when the fountain pen runs out of ink. It's cool because I can drop a photo from the day into an entry as a visual reminder of whatever I'm writing about.

So there you have it. The right tool for each task.
