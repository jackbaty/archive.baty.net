title: I want to own a movie theater

Someday, when I have an extra mountain of cash just sitting around, I'm going to buy a movie theater. A nice one, with just one screen. I'm going to keep everything clean and shiny and probably throw down some velvet.&nbsp; I'm going to show quality films that I think folks will enjoy. You'll never see a single commercial and the films will always start on time. You'll be able to buy popcorn and soda &#8211; cheap, because it really doesn't cost $6.00 to make a bucket of the stuff.

Then I'm going to hire ex-convicts as ushers. Lots of em. They'll carry clubs and not hesitate to use them on any asshole who talks **at all** during the movie. You don't want to know what they'll do to you if your phone rings &#8211; I don't care if it **was** an accident.
