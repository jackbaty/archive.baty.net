I hate iCal for lots of reasons that I no longer need to go into, since I've found the perfect replacement in the form of [Remind][1]. Yes, it's a geeky unix tool. Yes, it requires command line skillz, but imagine a single, light-weight text file with all of your events in it. Each line looks like this&#8230;

REM Sun AT 21:00 +15 DURATION 1:00 MSG Family Guy

That says every sunday at 9:00pm show me that Family Guy is on, and start to warn me 15 minutes before it starts. That's easy, but it can also do things like remind me&#8230;"every 3rd Tuesday from now until December 31st unless it's a holiday or blue moon"

Wrap it up using a fabulously simple Curses-based "gui" called [wyrd][2] (pronounced like "weird") and I've got lightweight, portable, fast, easy and flexible. All for free.

Oh, and I pipe the timed reminder alerts out through [Growl][3] so that it looks pretty when talking to me.

A nice piece by Mike Harris on [43Folders][4] should get you interested.

This [Linux Journal article][5] by the author is also helpful.
