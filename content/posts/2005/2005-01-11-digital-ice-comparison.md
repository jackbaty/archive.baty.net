In order to give my new scanner yet another test, I grabbed a random slide from the pile I'd scanned some time ago. This one happened to be of my dad in France during his Navy tour in something like 1961. I posted a [side-by-side][1] on Flickr, but here are a couple of crops demonstrating the difference in scans between the Nikon Coolscan V with Digital ICE and the Minolta Scan Duel III without. It's pretty dramatic.
