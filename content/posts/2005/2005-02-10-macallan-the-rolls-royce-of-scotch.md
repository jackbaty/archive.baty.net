I met up with my very old, very good friend Wayne tonight, whom I haven't seen in almost 3 years. He knows I'm a scotch lover and every year would buy me a good bottle on or near my birthday. He made up for missing a year or two tonight and bought me not one, but two glasses of Macallan 30-year-old. Oh dear lord, I've been spoiled! I might be able to afford one glass a month, but now I've got something to save my pennies for. Those of you who haven't climbed the learning curve of single-malt scotch should really think about it. Not many things on earth feel that good in a man's mouth. Not many at all.
