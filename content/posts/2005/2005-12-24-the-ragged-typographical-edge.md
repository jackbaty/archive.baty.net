I can never quite get used to reading "justified" text on the web, especially within the typically narrow columns used in most weblogs. It \_looks\_ better, but doesn't read as easily. I've changed this text to ragged right (left-justified) and even though it looks messier, I believe it's easier to read. 

\*\*[Update]\*\*: According to [WDG](<http://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/html/effects.html#right-align>), "Although justified text may look pretty, human factors analysis shows that ragged right is actually easier to read and understand." At least I'm not alone.
