Manton Reece recently shared the following [Sneak peek screenshot][1] of his upcoming microblogging app.

I can't wait to see what he's is working on. What I want it to be is a microblogging app that I run at my own domain and that can optionally syndicate to Twitter/Tumblr, etc. I'd like it to be less invasive than the [WordPress version of a microblog][3] I'm using today. It's good to see activity around this stuff.
