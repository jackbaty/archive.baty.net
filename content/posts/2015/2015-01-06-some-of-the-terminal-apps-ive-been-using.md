title: Some of the Terminal Apps I&#039;ve been using

I've been all-in on the command line for a while now. I basically live in a complex set of tmux panes. If you're interested in doing the same, here's a list of the apps I use regularly.

  * [tmux][1] &#8211; tmux is a terminal multiplexer. Ties everything together.
  * [Mutt][2] &#8211; There's no better way to handle email
  * [Vim][3] &#8211; The perfect text editor
  * [VimWiki][4] &#8211; I've fallen in love with vimwiki.
  * [jrnl][5] &#8211; The Command Line Journal. Writes to either plain text files or to [Day One][6].
  * [WeeChat][7] &#8211; IRC client. I find it easier to use than irssi.
  * [doing][8] &#8211; Brett Terpstra's simple app for recording what I'm doing. I use this for time tracking.
  * [turses][9] &#8211; Curses-based Twitter client. This is new to me and I'm not sure how often I'll use it but it's the best one I've found.
  * [Remind][10] &#8211; A ridiculously flexible calendar/reminder app.
  * [Wyrd][11] &#8211; Nice front end to Remind.
  * [Taskwarrior][12] &#8211; Manages lots of tasks without getting in the way.
  * [Vit][13] &#8211; Makes Taskwarrior feel like Vim.
