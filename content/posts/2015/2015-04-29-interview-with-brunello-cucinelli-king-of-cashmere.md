[Om Malik interviews Brunello Cucinelli][1]

> You must believe in the human being, because the creativity of a company — Let’s say you have a company with 1,000 people. Maybe we were told that there are only two or three genius people in the 1,000. But I think that if you have 1,000 people, you have 1,000 geniuses. They’re just different kinds of genius and a different degree of intensity. 

I want to quote the entire interview, but just go read it. Cucinelli is my new hero.
