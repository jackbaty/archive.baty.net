Michael Tsai's collection of people [Switching to Smaller iPhones][1]:

Count me in as someone who prefers the shape, size, and feel of an iPhone 5 over the iPhone 6. The 6 is the first phone that I felt _had_ to have a case or I'd drop it. It's too big and too slippery. I haven't gone back to a 5S only because the camera on the 6 is really nice. I'm actually hoping they release an iPhone Nano at some point<sup id="fnref-4363-notawatch"><a href="#fn-4363-notawatch" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
