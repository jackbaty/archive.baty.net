title: See You After the Election, Twitter
---

I've been doing my best to stay calm during the past few months of this insane
election season. My Twitter feed is mostly filled with sensible people like me
who believe Trump is nothing short of a threat to our existence. This is nice,
but even the folks who agree with me are becoming harsh and angry and shallow.

It's exhausting.

I'm going to bail on Twitter and other social media outlets until this is over.
See you on the other side.
