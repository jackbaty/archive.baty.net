![The Revenge of Analog](/img/2016/revenge-of-analog-cover.jpg)

If ever a book was meant for me,
"[The Revenge of Analog](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502374-the-revenge-of-analog)"
is it.

David Sax dives into the ongoing resurgence of analog: film photography, 
paper notebooks, vinyl records, even education. I believe all of these things
matter, and that their continued (and growing) use is for the better.

Sax perhaps sprinkles everything with a bit of unnecessary hyperbole, but he's
obviously excited about the same things I am, so I'll forgive the excess.

"The Revenge of Analog" is a fun and informative read for anyone even remotely
interested in the life or "real things"
