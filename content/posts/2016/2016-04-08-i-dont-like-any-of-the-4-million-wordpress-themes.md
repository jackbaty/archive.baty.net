title: I don’t like any of the 4 million WordPress themes

I’ve tried dozens of WordPress themes over the years and I’ve not liked any of them very much. There’s always _something_ that spoils it for me. I end up creating a Child Theme and farting around but I never end up with what I really wanted. I’m not talented enough and I'm too lazy to spend the time it would take to create something perfect myself. 

So, I’ve settled on the [Independent Publisher][1] theme for now. It’s pretty basic and I find it readable enough. There are things I’ll want to tweak (here we go again) but it’ll do.
