[Dr. Drang][1]

> I, of course, am stuck in the past, not willing to give up—or even share—the ownership of my words. Still clinging to a publishing model that may soon be as outdated as print. Erik’s hybrid system is probably the right way to accomodate the new realities while still maintaining control. But I’m not a fan of the new realities. I know the niche I’ve carved out is vanishingly small, but it’s all mine.

I try every new publishing tool and platform that shows up, but I'm very much stuck in the past. I will probably always write on my own blog in my own space. It's just better this way, even if few people read it.
