title: About that Learning Javascript article
---

Many of you may have read Jose Aguinaga's
post,[How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.3gse4qoix).
You may have laughed, or you may have cried. Maybe you did both.

I thought it was a fine way to poke a little fun at the runaway situation facing
the JavaScript community. Most of the reaction I've seen has been combination of
amused nods and quiet sighs. Some felt the need to rebut it. And some, of course,
felt attacked. None of this is surprising.

For me, there are a couple of ways to respond to an article like Aguinaga's. The
first is as an apologist. I feel Tom MacWright did this
with
[Everything is Fine with JavaScript](http://www.macwright.org/2016/10/04/everything-is-fine-with-javascript.html)

> If someone is holier-than-thou about technology choices, they’re wrong and you

The second, is to determine where the sentiment comes from and try to understand it, as Tim Kadlec does, in [Chasing Tools](https://timkadlec.com/2016/10/chasing-tools/)

> The thing is, it’s not the ecosystem that’s the problem. It’s great that we

I prefer the second option.
