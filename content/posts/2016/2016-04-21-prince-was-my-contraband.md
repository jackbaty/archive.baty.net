title: Prince was my contraband

I've always loved listening to Prince, although for a while I wouldn't let myself admit it to anyone.

In high school and for some time after, my friends and I listened to Metal and what is now called classic rock. Other than the occasional power ballad or "make out" songs, that was all I played. It was all I was _allowed_ to play.

In public, I would never have been seen listening to Prince. I would have been ostracized immediately. In private, however, I couldn't get enough of Controversy and 1999 and of course I wore out Purple Rain. I had a couple of his cassettes stashed in secret hiding spots in my car. I'd pull them out when driving home from parties or whatever.

I'm disappointed in that version of myself, but for a while prince was contraband.
