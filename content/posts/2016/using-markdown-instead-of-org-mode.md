title: Using Markdown instead of Org Mode
topics: []
---

I have recently abandoned using [Org Mode](http://orgmode.org), even though I
love nearly everything about it.

The problem is that even though Org Mode documents are technically just plain
text files, they are nearly useless outside of Emacs. Sometimes it's nice to use
a different editor. Sometimes it's nice to edit using an iPad Pro.

So I'm back to using Markdown. Writing documents using
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) can be done in any text
editor. Most modern editors support Markdown very well. Files synced via Dropbox
or whatever can be edited using any number of fine iOS-based editors. (I
currently use [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/))

It's the flexibility of Markdown editor options that compelled me to abandon Org
Mode. I still prefer Emacs for editing on the Mac, though. This is largely
because of Pandoc Mode and Orgtbl Mode.

The combination of Markdown mode and
[Pandoc mode](http://joostkremers.github.io/pandoc-mode/) for Emacs provides
many of the fancy bits of Org Mode, like folding, linking, etc. Pandoc
mode makes exporting to multiple output formats almost as flexible as Org Mode.

[Orgtbl-mode](http://orgmode.org/manual/Orgtbl-mode.html) is a minor mode which
allows me to work with Markdown-formatted tables as easily as I did in Org Mode.
Very handy.

The gist is that with a little setup, writing and publishing using Markdown can
be as easy and complete as with Org Mode, and I get to use whatever editor I
choose, on both my Mac and my iPad.
