[Zeldman][1]

> Flickr, while it yet lives, provides me with far richer layers of experience and capability than even the most tricked-out third-party Instagram app could dream of. I always used Instagram under protest, as a poor cousin. I used it because people were there, not because I liked it. I like Flickr, even though posting my photos there is kind of like leaving flowers at the grave of someone whose name I’ve forgotten.

Dammit, me too. I dislike everything about Instagram, except that Instagram is where the people are these days. I'm with Zeldman here and considering (once again) ending my time with Instagram. Besides, ghost town or no, [Flickr][2] still kicks Instagram's ass.
