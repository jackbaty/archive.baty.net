The posts on this blog can have tags, categories, or both. Sometimes I use tags, sometimes I use categories, sometimes I use both.

Lately, I've been using both. The default category is "Journal". I use tags like "film", "Nikon", etc. I noticed that for Categories I use pluralized words and for Tags I use the singular form. Neither are used consistently.

I've decided that Categories should be plural and Tags should be singular. This is because I think of Categories as things being _within a collection_ and Tags as _this post has a tag_. Or perhaps _this post is among other posts in this Category_ and _this post is tagged with this topic_.

It's a place to start, anyway.
