[Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge Program](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/criteria.md):

> This is a set of best practices for Free/Libre and Open Source Software
> (FLOSS) projects. Projects that follow these best practices will be able to
> voluntarily self-certify and show that they've achieved a Core Infrastructure
> Initiative (CII) badge. Projects can do this, at no cost, by using a web
> application (BadgeApp) to explain how they meet these practices and their
> detailed criteria.

I was thinking of starting a new open source project but I think I'll go work
for the government instead.
