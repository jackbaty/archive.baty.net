> No, my problem with Slack is that it is all hose and no bucket. You can search through conversations and find meaningful facts, but for us, at least, conversation is so easy that it can (and does) erode the impulse to do more end-to-end treatments of things. Community knowledge accretes but never quite pools.

"Community knowledge accretes but never quite pools". This is _exactly_ the
problem I've been grappling with. I introduced Slack at Fusionary during the
original beta and it's been fantastic, but like all messaging tools, it
sidesteps the need for collating corporate _knowledge_. 

A time-based stream of quick messages offers no coherent whole--no summary
derived from the experience.

A Tool like [Pingpad](https://pingpad.io/#/) is a step in the right direction but
it has a long way to go. We need _something_ though.
