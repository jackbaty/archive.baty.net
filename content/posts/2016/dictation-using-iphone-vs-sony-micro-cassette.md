title: Dictation using Apple Watch vs Sony Microcassette
topics: []
---

{{< figure src="/img/2016/iphone-vs-sony.jpg" title="" >}}

I carry a microcassette recorder in my car so that I can dictate quick notes
while driving, with minimal fuss. I've tried replacing it with using
Siri or other methods on my phone, but nothing is as quick and easy as the
little cassette recorder.
See [this earlier post](/2015/siri-vs-the-sony-microcassette-recorder/) for
details.

Today I discovered an iOS app that attempts to make voice recording as easy as
possible. It's
called
[Just Press Record](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-press-record/id1033342465?mt=8) and
I'm finding it very promising. It comes with an Apple Watch app and can be used
as a complication. This means that with a single tap on my watch, I can begin
recording and then have the audio and transcription automatically synced to my
phone (via iCloud).

One thing I'd like to see added to Just Press Record is an option
to automatically save each recording. I'd rather not need to tap the Save button
each time and just deal with deleting unwanted recordings later, while _not_
driving. The fewer taps the better for my use case.

Still, the Sony allows for dictation using one hand and without needing to take my eyes
off the road, so it remains to be seen whether using the watch can replace it in
the long run.
