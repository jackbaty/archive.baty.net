title: My System Keeps Failing
---

I found a web export of my
old [Delicious Library](https://www.delicious-monster.com) and it reminded me
how fun it had been to see all my books in a beautiful and playful format.
Delicious Library is a great app, but I'd stopped using it at some point for
reasons I don't remember. I put the old exported web site out in a Google Cloud
bucket for safe-keeping here: http://dellibrary.baty.net/

I thought it would be fun to see what had changed with Delicious Library since I
last used it, so I downloaded the latest version. Of course when I launched the
app my old library wasn't there. "No problem," I thought, and went looking for a
backup or export of the original library. It turns out that I don't have one.

How is it that after spending days and days entering books over several years, I
don't have a backup copy of my library? This represents a complete failure of my
"system". Now I feel like I have to spend time, again, making sure that I have a
way to archive and recover _everything_ that means something to me, or might
mean something to me in the future. 

Keep backup copies of everything, and know where they are and how to find them.
