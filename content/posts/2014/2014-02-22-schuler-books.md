I&#x2019;m going to miss having Schuler Books just a couple miles away. They&#x2019;ll be closing soon, for reasons that have been explained but that I don&#x2019;t buy. Every time I&#x2019;m there it&#x2019;s busy. Doesn&#x2019;t seem right that they can&#x2019;t make enough to keep the place open. 

I was there today for what could be my last time. I bought three books:

  * The Rosie Project, by Graeme Simsion
  * Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon
  * On Writing, by Stephen King

I&#x2019;d normally link those titles to Amazon but that seems wrong this time.
