In case I never get an account on the actual [tilde.club][1] server, I thought I'd make my own "tilde" server. It's running at an unused domain, [rudimentarylathe.org][2], which seems totally appropriate. Remember tildes? I love Paul Ford ([~ford][3]) for starting tilde.club and inspiring a bunch of people to open a shell and edit primordial HTML files directly.  Just write, hit :w and it's live!

My account is [rudimentarylathe.org/~jack][4].

The server also has mutt, pine, irc, nntp, etc. All local only. It's a beautiful little island. I hope to add more user accounts once I've gotten things settled. If you want one, let me know. No promises.
