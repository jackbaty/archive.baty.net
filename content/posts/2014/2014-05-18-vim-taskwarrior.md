[Taskwarrior][1] is a darn nice terminal-based task manager, but I sometimes tire of having to scan the list of tasks, find the task ID, then type `t 13 mod due:fri` or `t 13 done` every time.

Enter [vim-taskwarrior][2]&#8230;

> vim-taskwarrior is a vim plugin that extends taskwarrior with an interactive interface. It features a rich set of mappings and commands, is easy to customize, and makes adding, modifying, sorting, reporting and marking done, fast, easy and fun!

Nice.
