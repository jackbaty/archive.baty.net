title: Awful Adobe Max scheduler dialog
url: /2007/awful-adobe-max-scheduler-dialog/

I was trying to plan my schedule for Adobe Max next week using their nifty Flex app. The app is okay, but actually scheduling sessions was nearly impossible. I first spent 20 minutes organizing things, then closed the window. Every modern calendar app, _especially_ fancy new RIAs like this one, save your changes automatically. Nope. Start over. 

Trying to add a session caused a conflict with an existing one. Here's the dialog telling me what to do about it&#8230;

I still don't know which option I should pick. Guess I'll just wait until I get there. I'll bet it'll be much more fun that way.
