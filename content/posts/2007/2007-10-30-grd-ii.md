My GRD has had a broken LCD for months. I've been putting off the expensive repair on the off chance that Ricoh would release an updated version of this great little camera. Well, they just did.

Why am I going to immediately spend $700 a GRD II? 

* Under 4-second RAW write times with a buffer (vs 11 seconds on the GRD)
  

  
* Flash compensation
  

  
* 1:1 shooting, and available in RAW
  

  
* Noise Reduction ON/OFF switch!
  

  
* AE lock 

And it's still gorgeous! More at the [Ricoh site][1]. 

**Update:** Tony Rose at PopFlash is [taking $200 deposits][2] on first order shipments. He's got my money already.
