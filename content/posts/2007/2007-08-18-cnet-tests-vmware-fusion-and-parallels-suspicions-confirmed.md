I've been using Parallels to run Windows on my MacBookPro since the day it was released. Virtualization is pretty sweet, but tends to bring my machine to its knees. And then, after trying "VMWare Fusion":http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/ for a few days, I uninstalled Parallels without a second thought. The reason? Fusion felt a whole lot faster and more stable. I didn't have any charts or anything to back that up. But now, "CNET does":bhttp://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9760910-1.html. 

For Windows when I need it, Fusion wins.
