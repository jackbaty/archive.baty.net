title: Apollo’s real value

I typically scan Ryan Stewart's blog for new information on RIAs and Adobe stuff, but then ignore much of the knee-jerk fawning over anything remotely RIA related. His recent post, [Offline is a Small Part of the Apollo Value][1] is spot on however. All of the latest hoo-ha about taking web apps offline has gotten things backwards. What many of us will be building instead of web apps we can use offline is creating _desktop apps_ (with things like Apollo) using all of the fabulous web technologies we already know, then letting them seamlessly take advantage of online access. The difference is subtle, but important. To quote Ryan: 

> &#8230;the biggest value of Apollo will is[sic]: **Desktop applications that can be built with web technologies.**
