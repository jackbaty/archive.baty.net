Steven Poole's "Goodbye Cruel Word":http://stevenpoole.net/blog/goodbye-cruel-word/ describes a pretty good set of reasons why he dumped Word for a couple of fantastic Mac editors: "Scrivener":http://literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html and "WriteRoom":http://hogbaysoftware.com/projects/writeroom. If I were a writer, I'd do exactly the same thing. If everyone else did the same maybe I'd finally stop getting things mailed to me as Word docs. I don't have Word either. Never did.
