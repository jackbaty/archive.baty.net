            Back at the Olympia tonight. It's on nights like this &#8212; nights involving at least 2 glasses of wine &#8212; that I become convinced I'm better off away from computers of any kind. Away from people, both online and off. Another glass of wine and a bit of whine and I'm all set.

            THWACK! go the keys. Pounding out letter after letter, one after another, forming (in time) several sentences &#8211; sentences much like this one.

            Then it goes quiet again.
