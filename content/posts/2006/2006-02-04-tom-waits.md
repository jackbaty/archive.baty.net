![Tom][1] 

I feel the need to remind you all that Tom Waits is a genius. Do me a favor and pick an album from iTunes and buy it. His music is brooding, experimental, noisy and somehow sweet. Seriously, pick any of them. Try \_Alice\_, \_Mule Variations\_, or \_Rain Dogs\_ to start. Each of those three is entirely different from the others. Each is wonderful in its own way. </p>
