![Night of the Hunter][1] 

I'd never even heard of [Night of the Hunter][1] (1955) before seeing it on the list of [102 Movies you must see before&#8230;][2]. Shame on me, it's wonderful. Standouts&#8230; 

* The "LOVE/HATE" tattoos on Powell's hands 
* Lillian Gish with a shotgun 
* The bedroom which looked like some sort of cathedral 
* Powell singing that damn song all the time &#8211; creepy. 
* Underwater shot of Shelley Winter's corpse &#8211; even more creepy. 

It's a terrifying, stylish nightmare of a film.
