I use Ruby on Rails every day and \*just now\* discovered you can run ./script/about from your Rails app root. Here's some sample output&#8230; 

$ ./script/about 

About your application's environment 

Ruby version 1.8.4 (i686-darwin8.5.2) 

RubyGems version 0.8.11 

Rails version 1.0.0 

Active Record version 1.13.2 

Action Pack version 1.11.2 

Action Web Service version 1.0.0 

Action Mailer version 1.1.5 

Active Support version 1.2.5 

Edge Rails revision 35 

Application root /Users/jbaty/Sites/mysite.com

So many things I don't know about, but there's one fewer today.
