I've fallen a bit off the GTD wagon of late. How do I know? First, I missed 2 things I should've easily gotten done recently. Another clue is that I feel like I have too many things to think about and I just \*know\* I'm forgetting something. And I've not done a thorough weekly review in 3 weeks. This is bad. Merlin Mann talks a bit about [getting back on the GTD wagon](<http://www.43folders.com/2006/07/24/b2gtd-mind-sweep/>) by doing a Mind Sweep. This is good advice for anyone who, like me, has not bet Getting Things Done. The takaway for me is to always remember to completely separate planning from doing&#8230;.
