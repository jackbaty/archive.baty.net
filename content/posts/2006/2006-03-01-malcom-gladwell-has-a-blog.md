New Yorker columnist and author of \_Blink\_ and \_Tipping Point\_ Malcolm Gladwell has a [blog][1]. You see, he's a \_writer\_ with a blog. This means he has interesting things to say and writes them in a coherent and interesting way &#8211; on his blog. Exactly the inverse of most of what's in your RSS reader right now, I'd wager. You should read it.
