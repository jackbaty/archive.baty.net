The folks at [Flickr][1] have released a Flash app called Organizr. It's basically a nice interface for creating photo "sets", searching, browsing and whatnot. Interesting that they worked pretty hard to make the Flash app _look_ like an HTML app.

The notable thing here is that Organizr is built easily on top of the existing Flickr API, which is [documented here][2] for everyone to use.
