Laszlo has always looked like a good idea, but I wasn't interested in lockin to yet another vendor by buying into an expensive, proprietary system. Apparently this was a common feeling. In response, and wisely, [Laszlo Systems][1] has released what looks like the entire platform under the CPL open source license. This means it's free (as in beer _and_ speech). Somehow, I'll bet that turns out to be a very important detail.
