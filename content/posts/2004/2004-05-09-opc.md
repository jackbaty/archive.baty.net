I'm realizing that the only thing more frustrating than editing uncommented, goofily written code is editing Other People's CSS. There are never any comments, and it's nearly impossible to figure out whatever naming conventions or structural guidelines may have been intended, even though they were never followed.

We've replaced complicated inline markup with even more complicated abstracted markup. Heretical as the thought is, I'm beginning to wish we'd sacrifice a teeny bit of semantic clarity for a dose of maintainability.
