title: A nicer template

I really don't care a whole lot about the visual presentation of this site beyond the usual "clean" approach that I prefer. Or it might be that I care, but lack the skills to do much about it. Either way, my site ain't pretty much.

[Jay][1] put together a very clean, basic template at [the office][2] which was originally meant as a wireframe template only. I kind of liked it, so I've implemented it here. It's cleaner and uses much better markup than before. I might even get crazy with the stylesheet someday, but for now this will have to do.
