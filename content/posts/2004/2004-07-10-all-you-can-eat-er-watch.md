I've been a member of Netflix since sometime in 2002 and they've been good to me. The thought of switching to Blockbuster's (or anyone else's) version of movie-rental-via-internet never crossed my mind, and still hasn't.

The problem with Netflix (and similar services) is lack of spontaneity. Quite often I know which movie I want to see _tonight_, and of course I don't have it and it's not even in my queue. Inevitably, I run to the local Blockbuster and rent it. And (also inevitably), I end up paying 4 or 5 dollars in late fees.

Blockbuster now has a program _in the stores_ that changes things. For $24.95/month, I can have any 2 movies out at a time, with no late fees or due dates. When I want another movie (or two), I just go exchange the movies I have out for new ones. I can do that as many times as I want.

When I inquired about this service, the girl behind the counter said, "Let's take a look here at your account and&#8230;" Her eyes widened in disbelief, "&#8230;Oh dear, you'll definitely save money this way!" Apparently she had spotted my late fee totals for the past few months.

So, I signed up, grabbed a couple movies and went home. I suddenly can't wait to decide what I want to watch tonight.

It's like Netflix without the lag.
