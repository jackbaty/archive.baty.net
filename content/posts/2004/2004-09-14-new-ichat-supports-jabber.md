title: New iChat supports Jabber

According to this [Apple Insider article][1], the new iChat will support the Jabber protocol. I've been a fan of [Jabber][2] for a very long time. I even tried convincing a few coworkers to run a Jabber client, but it was too early. Jabber is a platform, not an IM service. I hope that more support like that from Apple will give it enough good press to make it relevant.
