One of life's great things is being near the beginning of a book you just know you're going to love.&nbsp; This is what's happening to me right now with Don DeLillo's [White Noise][1]

Some have complained that there are no real characters, only psychological constructs used simply to convey the author's point of view. Well Duh! Characters schmaracters, there are some clever, interesting and fun things coming out of those constructs, and I love it!
