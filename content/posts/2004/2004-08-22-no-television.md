It's been almost 4 months since my Dish went wonky. At first I panicked, worried that some new reality show would pass me by unwatched. Oh wait, I hate reality shows. No big deal then.

It turns out that there's _nothing_ on or about television that I miss.

  * World Events: [CNN][1], [NYT][2] and about 400 weblogs do a pretty good job


  * Local News: Nothing happens here and what does happen is reported by people I seriously dislike listening to.


  * Sports: Not interested. Except for the Olympics. The [Olympics page][3] on Wikipedia is keeping up-to-date on that.


  * Entertainment: Well, between my reading list, Netflix queue and the afore-mentioned 400 weblogs I think I've got that covered.


  * Culture: You're kidding, right?
</ul> 

The best thing about television is that it allows you to feel like you're doing something, while actually doing nothing. Since I'm openly lazy, I don't need that.
