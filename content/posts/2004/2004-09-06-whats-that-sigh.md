I've had a few people comment lately that I seem a little off. Not unhappy exactly, just a bit more off than usual. It's almost as if the grumpy act I tend to put on is not as much an act as at was.

I don't _feel_ crabby, but I suspect that I might just _be_ a little crabby. To those affected by this, I apologize. It's just a phase. I'm sure of it.
