I'm as much a techo-geek fanatic as the next guy, but it seems I keep falling back on old tech. I bought Jess a 50s era rotary telephone for her birthday. Why? Because holding the handset to your ear for hours is much more comfortable than with _any_ fancy new 1Ultra-GHZ cordless phone. Also, you never accidently hang it up with your cheek, I can _always_ find it, the battery never goes dead, and you can drop it from a 6-story building with no ill effects (assuming it doesn't land on someone). And it's orange.
