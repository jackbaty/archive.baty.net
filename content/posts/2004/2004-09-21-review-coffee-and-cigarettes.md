Jim Jarmusch films are something else entirely. I hated _Ghost Dog_ and really hated his Cannes-winning _Stranger than Paradise_. On the other hand I loved _Dead Man_, _Mystery Train_ and _Night on Earth_.

[Coffee and Cigarettes][1] falls into the category of successes. Imagine 11 shorts, shot in grainy black and white, starring some of the coolest folks anywhere: Iggy Pop, Tom Waits, Meg and Jack White (The White Stripes), Steven Wright, Bill Murray, GZA and RZA and on and on.

No plot, many uneven bits, but overall plenty to enjoy. And of course I'm suddenly wishing I'd never quit smoking.
