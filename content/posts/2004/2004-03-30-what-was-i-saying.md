Excitedly, I opened the "new entry" window in Movable Type and prepared to enter something. Then&#8230;

Oops! Noodles are done&#8230; run into kitchen. Lay the noodles out nicely and cover with the meat sauce that took me like three hours to make. I use the term "sauce" loosely, as it ended up with a consistency of say, beef barbeque. Oh well, I finish putting together my very first attempt at real lasagna and head back into the office.

&#8230; I have no idea what I was going to write. None. It was probably something devilishly clever too, dammit!

So I wrote this instead.
