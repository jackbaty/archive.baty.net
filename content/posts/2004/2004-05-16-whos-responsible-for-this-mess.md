Well, that would be me. My name is Jack Baty.

By day (and many nights), I'm one of the partners at [Fusionary Media][1]. There's not a better place to be and I love every minute of it.

Nights are usually spent trying to become a better programmer, photographer, cook or whatever else seems interesting this week. Otherwise, I'll just read and watch movies.

You can, if you so choose, contact me at [][2]

Sometimes I'm on IM (AOL) with screen name jackbaty2k.
