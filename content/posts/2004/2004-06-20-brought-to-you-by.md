I went with my dad and family to a [Whitecaps][1] game today. I'm not a baseball fan, but I enjoy actually going to the park and watching a game now and then. This is the first time that the advertising really got to me. I don't think there was a single sentence spoken by the announcer that didn't contain an advertisement of some sort. "In the [company name] bull pen&#8230;", "Welcome to [company name] ballpark", "Now it's time for the [company name] three-legged race."

Nearly every surface, both vertical and horizontal, was covered with a logo or something definitely not-baseball. Then, a very attractive girl walked by wearing excessively low and tight jeans sporting that obnoxious hey-look-I'm-wearing-damn-expensive-jeans Von Dutch logo.

I give up.
