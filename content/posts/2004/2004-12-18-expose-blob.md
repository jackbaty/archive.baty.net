A hidden expose feature exposes an aqua blue "blob" which triggers Expose's App mode when clicked. As a new Mac user, Expose is one of the things that makes me love my decision to switch. I do tend to trigger it a bit too easily, and the [Expose Blob][1] solves the problem nicely. Once enabled, it displays a shiny blob that floats above everything and when clicked, triggers Expose. Drag it mostly off screen to make it less obtrusive. You can enable it using the command listed in the article, or us [Onyx][2].
