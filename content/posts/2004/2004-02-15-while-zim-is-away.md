Zim is at training for a month, and I miss the little bugger even more than I thought I would. I got word today that John, the breeder at Shafer Lake Kennels, posted one of Zim's pictures on his site. The page is [here][1]. Scroll down a bit, it's the one with Jessica in the leaves.

And here's one of the fam, just to hold me over.
