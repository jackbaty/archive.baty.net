I watched the Dawn of the Dead remake a few weeks ago and was bored silly. I said at the time that I never needed to see another zombie movie. I was wrong. [Shaun of the Dead][1] is the only zombie movie I needed to see. Actually, see Romero's original if you haven't, but other than that with _Shaun_ you're good to go. It's funny, a little sweet, and zombies literally tear the guts out of at least one of the lead characters. Can't beat that with a Cricket bat.
