Just added another one to the reading list. [The Philosophy Gym. 25 Short Adventures in Thinking][1]

![][2]

Discusses things like&#8230;

</p> 

  * Is Time Travel Possible?


  * What is Knowledge?


  * The Consciousness Conundrum
</ul> 

Seems like an easy intro to philosophy, which I know nothing about.
