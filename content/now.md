A few of the things I’m doing as of **Sunday, September 6, 2020**

- Living in [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). This now includes the content that was formerly maintained on [the
  wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org/).
- Playing with [HEY email](https://hey.com/)
- Dusted off baty.net and am revamping the whole thing
- Learning to edit video a little
- Experimenting with [Teamwork](https://www.teamwork.com)
- Considering [SmugMug](https://jackbaty.smugmug.com/) again
- Oh yeah, we sold [the company](https://fusionary.com/), so I’m now a consultant there, 3 days a week. It’s weird, but exciting.
